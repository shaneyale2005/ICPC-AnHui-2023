这是2023年安徽省ICPC本科生赛道的参考答案，其中最后一题样例格式有问题, 题面说 $c_i$ 可能小于0， $p_i$ 一定大于0，但样例中 $c_i$ 全都大于0， $p_i$ 却小于0，故暂时没法做，先以我们组的理解为准。   

Here is the reference solution for the 2023 Anhui Province ICPC Undergraduate Track. There is an issue with the sample format of the last problem. The problem statement mentions that $c_i$ can be less than 0 and $p_i$ must be greater than 0, but in the sample, all $c_i$ values are greater than 0 and $p_i$ values are less than 0. Therefore, we are unable to solve it based on the given sample. We will proceed based on our team's understanding for now.
